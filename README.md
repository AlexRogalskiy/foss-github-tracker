We publish most of the code we produce at Marmelab, apart from the code for customers of course, on Github. However, all these repositories are not intended to make open-source projects, that is to say maintained projects. PROT is a tool that allows us to track our public repositories in order to make sure that the ones we declare as hand held are the ones we leave public without maintaining them.
